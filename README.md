# Basic-Machine-Learning-Implementation

here I am going to implement Machine learning Algorithm in Pyhton3 from scratch :
1. Linear Regression using Graient Descent and Normal Equation method
2. Logistic Regrression using Gradient Descent ,Normal Equation (one for all) and using Neural Network
    backpropagation and forward propagation . 
3. Project code for Cat Image identifier using binary classification dataset of images.
4. Adding feature scaling , normalization , precision , ploting data, regularization
